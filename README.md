`nbref` is a reference implementation of accessible computational notebook interfaces.
the design of `nbref` is novel because:

1. notebooks can be rendered client side in pure javascript
2. it is designed from aria rules and principles
3. a progressive application from read to coding mode, or browse to focus mode on a screen reader
4. accessibility settings to control color, font, layout gives offers flexibility
